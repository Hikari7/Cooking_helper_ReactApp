## Features

The web app has three useful pages for cooking

- Searching menus by grocery name
- Searing menu by calculated calories you expected
- Grocery list (having the edit mode)

All pages were created by React Hooks efficiently.

## Challenging Part

It was the first time to create React App on my own and use Tailwind. Outputting my knowledge helped me to get used to using them surely!
